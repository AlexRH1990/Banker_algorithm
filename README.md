### Banker's Algorithm Project with Graphical User Interface in Java
## Description
This project implements  Banker's Algorithm in Java, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) developed with Swing. The algorithm's purpose is to prevent deadlock in resource allocation systems by ensuring the system remains in a safe state before allocating resources to processes.

## Main Features
# Banker's Algorithm Simulation: 
The project includes a complete implementation of the Banker's Algorithm, which assesses whether the system can satisfy all resource requests without entering an unsafe state.
# Graphical User Interface (GUI):
The project features several screens allowing users to visualize and manage processes, available resources, maximum and allocated matrices, and process states.
# Real-Time Evaluation: 
The GUI provides real-time feedback on the system's safety status, indicating completed processes and those still in progress.

## Project Structure

# Inicio.class: 
The main class that handles the program's logic and initializes the GUI.
# Inicio.form: 
The design file for the graphical interface.
# Other associated classes:
Include brief descriptions of other relevant classes (if applicable).

## Usage

# Running the Project:
The project was developed in NetBeans and can be run by opening the project in NetBeans, compiling the classes, and executing the main class.
# Interacting with the GUI: 
Upon starting the program, the GUI will provide three main buttons:
View Processes and Resources: Displays a table with processes, available resources, the maximum matrix, and the allocated matrix.
# System Evaluation:
Prints the completed and running processes and the remaining needs on the screen.
# Restart Simulation:
Allows restarting the simulation with new random data.

# Requirements
Java 8 or higher
NetBeans IDE (or any Java-compatible development environment)
